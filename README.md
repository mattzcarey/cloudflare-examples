# Cloudflare Worker and Durable Object Monorepo

> typesafe and fun

## Examples

### Durable Object

- [ ] State persistence
- [ ] SQLite database
- [ ] Object storage
- [ ] WebSocket connection
- [ ] Request/Response with rpc

### Worker A

- [ ] server using `hono`
- [ ] rpc communication with Worker B

### Worker B

## Mini hacks and bugs

Setting the ports for the workers in the dev scripts allows you to run all the workers locally with `npm run dev`.
